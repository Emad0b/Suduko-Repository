Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (known as "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9, without repetition. The puzzle starts with some cells pre-filled with numbers, and your goal is to fill in the remaining cells following the rules of the game.
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to play Sudoku:

1.The Grid: A Sudoku grid consists of 9 rows, 9 columns, and 81 cells in total. The grid is divided into nine 3x3 regions. Some cells within the grid will have numbers already filled in; these are called "given" or "clue" numbers.

2.Rules:
  #Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
  #Each column must also contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
  #Each of the nine 3x3 regions must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9, with no repetition.
3.Solving Strategy:
  #Start with an empty cell and consider what numbers are possible for that cell based on the rules.
  #Look at the numbers already present in the same row, column, and region to determine what number should go in that cell.
  #Repeat this process, moving from one empty cell to the next, considering the constraints of the game, until the entire grid is filled.
